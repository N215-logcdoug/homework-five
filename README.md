# homework-five
In this assignment, I recreated the about page from the travel fly Adobe XD file. This included making changes to the navbar for that page, making the about description section, and creating the client quotes section. Additionally, all parts were supposed to be responsive. To do this, I made the client quotes components stack vetically rather than horizontally when the page width gets to a certain point.
